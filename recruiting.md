The <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group is a new research group forming in the Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. This page contains information for prospective Ph.D. students about our research, what we can accomplish together, and how to apply.

I am recruiting Ph.D. students to join the group in Fall 2025 (**applications due December 1, 2024**).

## Why am I looking for PhD students?

Society's most pressing ethical and political questions around technology require interdisciplinary creativity to answer. To create long-term responses to these questions, we need people who are trained to think deeply about how the design of technology reflects normative values and shapes power relations, _and_ are trained to put these ideas into practice by creating new technology that advances equity and justice.

At the <span class="dnd">Data & Design</span> Group, we are creating a collaborative and inclusive space for people to grow into interdisciplinary researchers that are equipped to respond to society's needs. As a research group, we will help each other cultivate a [_critical technical practice_](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/critical.html), using design as a way to study and reimagine socio-technical systems.

## What kind of work does the <span class="dnd">D&D</span> Group do?

Current priority areas for the group include _accessible data analysis_ and _data ethics and refusal_. Our projects involve a variety of methods and outputs: system design, qualitative work, design frameworks, etc.

**Accessible data analysis**

We partner with blind collaborators and study participants to co-design novel interfaces for non-visual data exploration. These interfaces support the autonomy and agency of blind users to conduct self-guided data analysis and help them establish common ground with sighted users with shared spatial data metaphors.

Example projects:

- [Olli](/projects/olli/)
- [Umwelt](/projects/umwelt/)

Example papers:

- [Rich Screen Reader Experiences for Accessible Data Visualization](/publications/rich-screen-reader-vis-experiences/)
- [“Customization is Key”: Reconfigurable Content Tokens for Accessible Data Visualizations](/publications/customization/)
- [Umwelt: Accessible Structured Editing of Multi-Modal Data Representations](/publications/umwelt/)

We also have work in progress on tactile data representations and AI-assisted interpretation, which are potential directions for continued exploration.

**Data ethics and refusal**

We bring together methods from design, empirical social science, and feminist moral philosophy to design software systems that protect the autonomy of research participants online, and develop conceptual frameworks for data refusal to support designers and activists in saying “no” to large-scale data collection by powerful actors.

Example papers:

- [Bartleby: Procedural and Substantive Ethics in the Design of Research Ethics Systems](/publications/bartleby/)
- [Data Refusal from Below: A Framework for Understanding, Evaluating, and Envisioning Refusal as Design](/publications/data-refusal/)

In the future, we might explore co-designing systems with data refusers, or thinking about the ethics of social media data archiving.

## What can I expect to work on?

As a new Ph.D. student joining the group, I expect to work with you to identify a project that builds on the group's existing work in accessibility or data ethics. This is because I want new group members to use the first project as a learning experience, to align on an understanding of the end-to-end research process. Working with you on an initial project where I have more upfront involvement in scoping the project and identifying the audience is a way for me to scaffold that learning experience. As you progress in your Ph.D., I expect that we will work together to develop projects that advance your growth as an independent researcher and articulate your unique research perspective.

## What kind of applicants am I looking for?

I am looking for applicants with any disciplinary background who:

- are developing a point of view on technology and society
- are excited to contribute to and shape the shared research trajectory of the group
- want to build interdisciplinary skills across engineering, design, social sciences, and the humanities
- can help create a welcoming and inclusive research group culture
- have the potential to grow into leaders in our group, the department, and the wider field of HCI

As you think about working with me, I also encourage you to consider other faculty in Information Science who you might have common interests with, who might be potential future mentors, collaborators, or committee members.

## What is my perspective on advising?

The goal of a Ph.D. is to launch your career as a researcher (whether in academia, industry, civil service, or otherwise). In that process, an advisor plays many roles at different times: collaborator, thought partner, coach, advocate, and more. At a baseline, I believe successful advising relationships require trust, proactive communication, and clear expectation setting from both parties.

Acknowledging that people enter grad school with different goals and experiences, I see my job as figuring out how I can best help you succeed. Sometimes this will mean challenging you to stretch your capabilities so you can grow; other times, it will mean getting out of the way so you can fully exercise your agency. How this will work in practice is something we can figure out together.

## How do I apply?

Apply through the CU Boulder application system, linked below. In your cover letter, please name me as a prospective advisor so that I see your application.
