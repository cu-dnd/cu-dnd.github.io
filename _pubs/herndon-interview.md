This conversation between Holly Herndon, Tabea Nixdorff and Jonathan Zong occurred via Zoom on Tuesday, 29 September, 2020, at 16:00 Central European Time. We were in Berlin, Arnhem, Cambridge (MA), and Ghent (NY). This is the second publication of Version Space, a series of pamphlets transcribing conversations among artists and graduate students in visual art regarding Artificial Intelligence and related topics, produced in collaboration with Library Stack and funded by the Artistic Research program of the Sandberg Instituut, where Angie Keefer was a research fellow in the Department of Fine Arts for the academic years 2018–19 and 2019–20. The conversations take place via videoconference, are recorded, transcribed by an AI, then edited for clarity by humans, including Keefer, the participants, and Library Stack. The series title is borrowed from a machine learning framework conceived in the 1980s as a technique for identifying a range of possibilities in the overlap between maximally general and maximally specific hypotheses.
