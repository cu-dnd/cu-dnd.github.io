### Abstract

Debriefing is an essential research ethics procedure in
non-consented research where participants are
informed about their participation in research and
provided with controls over their data privacy. This
demonstration presents a novel system for conducting
and studying debriefing in large-scale behavioral
experiments online. We designed a debriefing system,
with an accompanying evaluation study, which are both
delivered as a web application. Participants engage with
this system once data collection for an experiment has
concluded. The key contributions of this project are 1)
the design and implementation of the debriefing system
for field experiments, and 2) an approach to empirically
evaluating public perception of research procedures.
